I started with a simple script to open an image:\nimport sys from PIL import Image im = Image.open(f\u0026#34;Tests/images/hopper.{sys.argv[1]}\u0026#34;) Then ran:\n$ python3.15 -m profiling.sampling run --flamegraph /tmp/1.py png Captured 35 samples in 0.04 seconds Sample rate: 1,000.00 samples/sec Error rate: 25.71 Flamegraph data: 1 root functions, total samples: 26, 169 unique strings Flamegraph saved to: flamegraph_97927.html Which generates this flame graph:\nThe whole thing took 40 milliseconds, with half in Image.py\u0026rsquo;s open(). If you visit the interactive HTML page we can see open() calls preinit(), which in turn imports GifImagePlugin, BmpImagePlugin, PngImagePlugin and JpegImagePlugin (hover over the \u0026lt;module\u0026gt; boxes to see them).\nDo we really need to import all those plugins when we\u0026rsquo;re only interested in PNG?\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s try another kind of image:\n$ python3.15 -m profiling.sampling run --flamegraph /tmp/1.py webp Captured 59 samples in 0.06 seconds Sample rate: 1,000.00 samples/sec Error rate: 22.03 Flamegraph data: 1 root functions, total samples: 46, 256 unique strings Flamegraph saved to: flamegraph_98028.html Hmm, 60 milliseconds with 80% in open() and most of that in init(). The HTML page shows it imports AvifImagePlugin, PdfImagePlugin, WebpImagePlugin, DcxImagePlugin, DdsImagePlugin and PalmImagePlugin. We also have preinit importing GifImagePlugin, BmpImagePlugin and PngImagePlugin.\nAgain, why import even more plugins when we only care about WebP?\nLoading all the plugins? #That\u0026rsquo;s enough profiling, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the code.\nWhen open()ing or save()ing an image, if Pillow isn\u0026rsquo;t yet initialised, we call a preinit() function. This loads five drivers for five formats by importing their plugins: BMP, GIF, JPEG, PPM and PNG.\nDuring import, each plugin registers its file extensions, MIME types and some methods used for opening and saving.\nThen we check each of these plugins in turn to see if one will accept the image. Most of Pillow\u0026rsquo;s plugins detect an image by opening the file and checking if the first few bytes match a magic prefix. For example:\nGIF starts with b\u0026quot;GIF87a\u0026quot; or b\u0026quot;GIF89a\u0026quot;. PNG starts with b\u0026quot;\\211PNG\\r\\n\\032\\n\u0026quot; (reference). JPEG starts with b\u0026quot;\\xff\\xd8\\xff\u0026quot;, where \\xff\\xd8 means \u0026ldquo;Start of Image\u0026rdquo;, and \\xff is the start of the next marker (reference). If none of these five match, we call init(), which imports the remaining 42 plugins. We then check each of these for a match.\nThis has been the case since at least PIL 1.1.1 released in 2000 (this is the oldest version I have to check). There were 33 builtin plugins then and 47 now.\nLazy loading #This is all a bit wasteful if we only need one or two image formats during a program\u0026rsquo;s lifetime, especially for things like CLIs. Longer running programs may need a few more, but unlikely all 47.\nA benefit of the plugin system is third parties can create their own plugins, but we can be more efficient with our builtins.\nI opened a PR to add a mapping of file extensions to plugins. Before calling preinit() or init(), we can instead do a cheap lookup, which may save us importing, registering, and checking all those plugins.\nOf course, we may have an image without an extension, or with the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; extension, but that\u0026rsquo;s fine; I expect it\u0026rsquo;s rare and anyway we\u0026rsquo;ll fall back to the original preinit() -\u0026gt; init() flow.\nAfter merging the PR, here\u0026rsquo;s a new flame graph for opening PNG (HTML page):\nAnd for WebP (HTML page):\nThe flame graphs are scaled to the same width, but there\u0026rsquo;s far fewer boxes meaning there\u0026rsquo;s much less work now. We\u0026rsquo;re down from 40 and 60 milliseconds to 20 and 20 milliseconds.\nThe PR has a bunch of benchmarks which show opening a PNG (that previously loaded five plugins) is now 2.6 times faster. Opening a WebP (that previously loaded all 47 plugins), is now 14 times faster. Similarly, Saving PNG is improved by 2.2 times and WebP by 7.9 times. Success! This will be in Pillow 12.2.0.\nSee also # Henry Schreiner on making packaging faster.\nAdam Johnson\u0026rsquo;s tprof is another new tool which is useful for things like this.\n","date":"28 January 2026","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2026/faster-pillow/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Speeding up Pillow's open and save"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/tachyon/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"tachyon"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"tags"},{"content":"I gave a lightning talk at a bunch of conferences in 2025 about some of the exciting new things coming in Python 3.14, including template strings.\nOne thing we can use t-strings for is to prevent SQL injection.

It is an irrational number, which means it cannot be written as a simple fraction of two integers. When written as a decimal, its digits go on forever without ever repeating a pattern.\nHere’s 76 digits of π:\n3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286\nPiphilology is the creation of mnemonics to help remember digits of π.\nIn a pi-poem, or “piem”, the number of letters in a word equal the corresponding digit.

The unofficial record is held by Akira Haraguchi who recited 100,000 digits in 2006.\nalpha 2 #2024-11-19\nLudolph van Ceulen (1540-1610) was a fencing and mathematics teacher in Leiden, Netherlands, and spent around 25 years calculating π (or pi), using essentially the same methods Archimedes employed some seventeen hundred years earlier.\nArchimedes estimated π by calculating the circumferences of polygons that fit just inside and outside of a circle, reasoning the circumference of the circle lies between these two values. Archimedes went up to polygons with 96 sides, for a value between 3.1408 and 3.1428, which is accurate to two decimal places.\nVan Ceulen used a polygon with half a billion sides. He published a 20-decimal value in his 1596 book Vanden Circkel (“On the Circle”), and later expanded it to 35 decimals:\n3.14159265358979323846264338327950288\nVan Ceulen’s 20 digits is more than enough precision for any conceivable practical purpose. For example, even if a printed circle was perfect down to the atomic scale, the thermal vibrations of the molecules of ink would make most of those digits physically meaningless. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s highest accuracy calculations, for interplanetary navigation, uses 15 decimals: 3.141592653589793.\nAt Van Ceulen’s request, his upper and lower bounds for π were engraved on his tombstone in Leiden. The tombstone was eventually lost but restored in 2000. In the Netherlands and Germany, π is sometimes referred to as the “Ludolphine number”, after Van Ceulen.\nalpha 3 #2024-12-17\nA mince pie is a small, round covered tart filled with “mincemeat”, usually eaten during the Christmas season – the UK consumes some 800 million each Christmas. Mincemeat is a mixture of things like apple, dried fruits, candied peel and spices, and originally would have contained meat chopped small, but rarely nowadays. They are often served warm with brandy butter.\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest mention of Christmas mince pies is by Thomas Dekker, writing in the aftermath of the 1603 London plague, in Newes from Graues-end: Sent to Nobody (1604):\nTen thousand in London swore to feast their neighbors with nothing but plum-porredge, and mince-pyes all Christmas.\nHere’s a meaty recipe from Rare and Excellent Receipts, Experienc’d and Taught by Mrs Mary Tillinghast and now Printed for the Use of her Scholars Only (1678):\nXV. How to make Mince-pies.\nTo every pound of Meat, take two pound of beef Suet, a pound of Corrants, and a quarter of an Ounce of Cinnamon, one Nutmeg, a little beaten Mace, some beaten Colves, a little Sack \u0026amp; Rose-water, two large Pippins, some Orange and Lemon peel cut very thin, and shred very small, a few beaten Carraway-seeds, if you love them the Juyce of half a Lemon squez’d into this quantity of meat; for Sugar, sweeten it to your relish; then mix all these together and fill your Pie. The best meat for Pies is Neats-Tongues, or a leg of Veal; you may make them of a leg of Mutton if you please; the meat must be parboyl’d if you do not spend it presently; but if it be for present use, you may do it raw, and the Pies will be the better.\nalpha 4 #2025-01-14\nIn Python, you can use Greek letters as constants. For example:\nfrom math import pi as π def circumference(radius: float) -\u0026gt; float: return 2 * π * radius print(circumference(6378.137)) # 40075.016685578485 alpha 5 #2025-02-11\n2025-01-29 marked the start of a new lunar year, the Year of the Snake 🐍 (and the Year of Python?).\nFor centuries, π was often approximated as 3 in China. Some time between the years 1 and 5 CE, astronomer, librarian, mathematician and politician Liu Xin (劉歆) calculated π as 3.154.\nAround 130 CE, mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Zhang Heng (張衡, 78–139) compared the celestial circle with the diameter of the earth as 736:232 to get 3.1724. He also came up with a formula for the ratio between a cube and inscribed sphere as 8:5, implying the ratio of a square’s area to an inscribed circle is √8:√5. From this, he calculated π as √10 (~3.162).\nThird century mathematician Liu Hui (刘徽) came up with an algorithm for calculating π iteratively: calculate the area of a polygon inscribed in a circle, then as the number of sides of the polygon is increased, the area becomes closer to that of the circle, from which you can approximate π.\nThis algorithm is similar to the method used by Archimedes in the 3rd century BCE and Ludolph van Ceulen in the 16th century CE (see 3.14.0a2 release notes), but Archimedes only went up to a 96-sided polygon (96-gon). Liu Hui went up to a 192-gon to approximate π as 157/50 (3.14) and later a 3072-gon for 3.14159.\nLiu Hu wrote a commentary on the book The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art which included his π approximations.\nIn the fifth century, astronomer, inventor, mathematician, politician, and writer Zu Chongzhi (祖沖之, 429–500) used Liu Hui’s algorithm to inscribe a 12,288-gon to compute π between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, correct to seven decimal places. This was more accurate than Hellenistic calculations and wouldn’t be improved upon for 900 years.\nHappy Year of the Snake!\nalpha 6 #2025-03-14\nMarch 14 is celebrated as pi day, because 3.14 is an approximation of π. The day is observed by eating pies (savoury and/or sweet) and celebrating π. The first pi day was organised by physicist and tinkerer Larry Shaw of the San Francisco Exploratorium in 1988. It is also the International Day of Mathematics and Albert Einstein’s birthday. Let’s all eat some pie, recite some π, install and test some py, and wish a happy birthday to Albert, Loren and all the other pi day children!\nalpha 7 #2025-04-08\nOn Saturday, 5th April, 3.141592653589793 months of the year had elapsed.\nbeta 1 #2025-05-07\nThe mathematical constant pi is represented by the Greek letter π and represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. The first person to use π as a symbol for this ratio was Welsh self-taught mathematician William Jones in 1706. He was a farmer’s son born in Llanfihangel Tre’r Beirdd on Angelsy (Ynys Môn) in 1675 and only received a basic education at a local charity school. However, the owner of his parents’ farm noticed his mathematical ability and arranged for him to move to London to work in a bank.\nBy age 20, he served at sea in the Royal Navy, teaching sailors mathematics and helping with the ship’s navigation. On return to London seven years later, he became a maths teacher in coffee houses and a private tutor. In 1706, Jones published Synopsis Palmariorum Matheseos which used the symbol π for the ratio of a circle’s circumference to diameter (hunt for it on pages 243 and 263 or here). Jones was also the first person to realise π is an irrational number, meaning it can be written as decimal number that goes on forever, but cannot be written as a fraction of two integers.\nBut why π? It’s thought Jones used the Greek letter π because it’s the first letter in perimetron or perimeter. Jones was the first to use π as our familiar ratio but wasn’t the first to use it in as part of the ratio. William Oughtred, in his 1631 Clavis Mathematicae (The Key of Mathematics), used π/δ to represent what we now call pi. His π was the circumference, not the ratio of circumference to diameter. James Gregory, in his 1668 Geometriae Pars Universalis (The Universal Part of Geometry) used π/ρ instead, where ρ is the radius, making the ratio 6.28… or τ. After Jones, Leonhard Euler had used π for 6.28…, and also p for 3.14…, before settling on and popularising π for the famous ratio.\nbeta 2 #2025-05-26\nIn 1897, the State of Indiana almost passed a bill defining π as 3.2.\nOf course, it’s not that simple.\nEdwin J. Goodwin, M.D., claimed to have come up with a solution to an ancient geometrical problem called squaring the circle, first proposed in Greek mathematics. It involves trying to draw a circle and a square with the same area, using only a compass and a straight edge. It turns out to be impossible because π is transcendental (and this had been proved just 13 years earlier by Ferdinand von Lindemann), but Goodwin fudged things so the value of π was 3.2 (his writings have included at least nine different values of π: including 4, 3.236, 3.232, 3.2325… and even 9.2376…).\nGoodwin had copyrighted his proof and offered it to the State of Indiana to use in their educational textbooks without paying royalties, provided they endorsed it. And so Indiana Bill No. 246 was introduced to the House on 18th January 1897. It was not understood and initially referred to the House Committee on Canals, also called the Committee on Swamp Lands. They then referred it to the Committee on Education, who duly recommended on 2nd February that “said bill do pass”. It passed its second reading on the 5th and the education chair moved that they suspend the constitutional rule that required bills to be read on three separate days. This passed 72-0, and the bill itself passed 67-0.\nThe bill was referred to the Senate on 10th February, had its first reading on the 11th, and was referred to the Committee on Temperance, whose chair on the 12th recommended “that said bill do pass”.\nA mathematics professor, Clarence Abiathar Waldo, happened to be in the State Capitol on the day the House passed the bill and walked in during the debate to hear an ex-teacher argue:\nThe case is perfectly simple. If we pass this bill which establishes a new and correct value for pi , the author offers to our state without cost the use of his discovery and its free publication in our school text books, while everyone else must pay him a royalty.\nWaldo ensured the senators were “properly coached”; and on the 12th, during the second reading, after an unsuccessful attempt to amend the bill it was postponed indefinitely. But not before the senators had some fun.\nThe Indiana News reported on the 13th:\n…the bill was brought up and made fun of. The Senators made bad puns about it, ridiculed it and laughed over it. The fun lasted half an hour. Senator Hubbell said that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing the State $250 a day, to waste its time in such frivolity. He said that in reading the leading newspapers of Chicago and the East, he found that the Indiana State Legislature had laid itself open to ridicule by the action already taken on the bill. He thought consideration of such a proposition was not dignified or worthy of the Senate. He moved the indefinite postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.\nbeta 3 #2025-06-17\nIf you’re heading out to sea, remember the Maritime Approximation:\nπ mph = e knots\nbeta 4 #2025-07-08\nAll this talk of π and yet some say π is wrong. Tau Day (June 28th, 6/28 in the US) celebrates τ as the “true circle constant”, as the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius, C/r = 6.283185… The Tau Manifesto declares π “a confusing and unnatural choice for the circle constant”, in part because “2π occurs with astonishing frequency throughout mathematics”.\nIf you wish to embrace τ the good news is PEP 628 added math.tau to Python 3.6 in 2016:\nWhen working with radians, it is trivial to convert any given fraction of a circle to a value in radians in terms of tau. A quarter circle is tau/4, a half circle is tau/2, seven 25ths is 7*tau/25, etc. In contrast with the equivalent expressions in terms of pi (pi/2, pi, 14*pi/25), the unnecessary and needlessly confusing multiplication by two is gone.\nrelease candidate 1 #2025-07-22\nToday, 22nd July, is Pi Approximation Day, because 22/7 is a common approximation of π and closer to π than 3.14.\n22/7 is a Diophantine approximation, named after Diophantus of Alexandria (3rd century CE), which is a way of estimating a real number as a ratio of two integers. 22/7 has been known since antiquity; Archimedes (3rd century BCE) wrote the first known proof that 22/7 overestimates π by comparing 96-sided polygons to the circle it circumscribes.\nAnother approximation is 355/113. In Chinese mathematics, 22/7 and 355/113 are respectively known as Yuelü (约率; yuēlǜ; “approximate ratio”) and Milü (密率; mìlǜ; “close ratio”).\nHappy Pi Approximation Day!\nrelease candidate 2 #2025-08-14\nThe magpie, Pica pica in Latin, is a black and white bird in the crow family, known for its chattering call.\nThe first-known use in English is from a 1589 poem, where magpie is spelled “magpy” and cuckoo is “cookow”:\nTh[e]y fly to wood like breeding hauke, And leave old neighbours loue, They pearch themselves in syluane lodge, And soare in th’ aire aboue. There : magpy teacheth them to chat, And cookow soone doth hit them pat.\nThe name comes from Mag, short for Margery or Margaret (compare robin redbreast, jenny wren, and its corvid relative jackdaw); and pie, a magpie or other bird with black and white (or pied) plumage. The sea-pie (1552) is the oystercatcher, the grey pie (1678) and murdering pie (1688) is the great grey shrike. Others birds include the yellow and black pie, red-billed pie, wandering tree-pie, and river pie. The rain-pie, wood-pie and French pie are woodpeckers.\nPie on its own dates to before 1225, and comes from the Latin name for the bird, pica.\nrelease candidate 3 #2025-09-18\nAccording to Pablo Galindo Salgado at PyCon Greece:\nThere are things that are supercool indeed, like for instance, this is one of the results that I\u0026rsquo;m more proud about. This equation over here, which you don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be scared about, but this equation here tells what is the maximum time that it takes for a ray of light to fall into a black hole. And as you can see the math is quite complicated but the answer is quite simple: it\u0026rsquo;s 2π times the mass of the black hole. So if you normalise by the mass of the black hole, the answer is 2π. And because there is nothing specific about your election of things in this formula, this formula is universal. It means it doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on anything other than nature itself. Which means that you can use this as a definition of π. This is a valid alternative definition of the number π. It\u0026rsquo;s literally half the maximum time it takes to fall into a black hole, which is kind of crazy. So next time someone asks you what π means you can just drop this thing and impress them quite a lot. Maybe Hugo could use this information to put it into the release notes of πthon [yes, I can, thank you!].\n3.14.0 (final) #2025-10-07\nEdgar Allen Poe died on 7th October 1849.\nAs we all recall from 3.14.0a1, piphilology is the creation of mnemonics to help memorise the digits of π, and the number of letters in each word in a pi-poem (or “piem”) successively correspond to the digits of π.\nIn 1995, Mike Keith, an American mathematician and author of constrained writing, retold Poe’s The Raven as a 740-word piem. Here’s the first two stanzas of Near A Raven:\nPoe, E. Near a Raven\nMidnights so dreary, tired and weary. Silently pondering volumes extolling all by-now obsolete lore. During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap! An ominous vibrating sound disturbing my chamber’s antedoor. “This”, I whispered quietly, “I ignore”.\nPerfectly, the intellect remembers: the ghostly fires, a glittering ember. Inflamed by lightning’s outbursts, windows cast penumbras upon this floor. Sorrowful, as one mistreated, unhappy thoughts I heeded: That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore - Is delighting, exciting…nevermore.\n3.14.1 #2025-12-02\nSeki Takakazu (関 孝和; c. March 1642 – December 5, 1708) was a Japanese mathematician and samurai who laid the foundations of Japanese mathematics, later known as wasan (和算, from wa (“Japanese”) and san (“calculation”).\nSeki was a contemporary of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz but worked independently. He created a new algebraic system, worked on infinitesimal calculus, and is credited with the discovery of Bernoulli numbers (before Bernoulli’s birth).\nSeki also calculated π to 11 decimal places using a polygon with 131,072 sides inscribed within a circle, using an acceleration method now known as Aitken’s delta-squared process, which was rediscovered by Alexander Aitken in 1926.\nHeader photo: A scan of Seki Takakazu\u0026rsquo;s posthumous Katsuyō Sanpō (1712) showing calculations of π.\n","date":"23 December 2025","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/and-now/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"And now for something completely different"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/pi/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"pi"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/pie/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"pie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/release/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"release"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/chart/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"chart"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/election/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"election"},{"content":"The Python Steering Council 2026 election results are in and congratulations to the new Python Steering Council!\nBarry Warsaw Donghee Na Pablo Galindo Salgado Savannah Ostrowski Thomas Wouters Welcome Savannah for the first time, and thank you to Greg Smith and Emily Morehouse for four and three years\u0026rsquo; service each.\nThree are starting their sixth terms, and four members have been or are release managers.\nThe chart above only covers the Steering Council years.

Thanks to Simon Willison for his useful TIL post about it.\nFirst install the CLI:\nbrew install 1password-cli Then open 1Password \u0026gt; Settings \u0026gt; Developer \u0026gt; Integrate with 1Password CLI.\nThen you can use the op command with your password item\u0026rsquo;s name in 1Password:\n$ op item get \u0026#34;My secret item\u0026#34; --fields password [use \u0026#39;op item get xkm4wrtpvnq8hcjd3yfzs2belg --reveal\u0026#39; to reveal] This obscures the actual password, and gives the item\u0026rsquo;s ID. You can use this ID:\n$ op item get xkm4wrtpvnq8hcjd3yfzs2belg --fields password [use \u0026#39;op item get xkm4wrtpvnq8hcjd3yfzs2belg --reveal\u0026#39; to reveal] Use --reveal to see the actual password:\n$ op item get \u0026#34;My secret item\u0026#34; --fields password --reveal my-secret-password $ op item get xkm4wrtpvnq8hcjd3yfzs2belg --fields password --reveal my-secret-password Alternatively, use a secret reference. Open the item in 1Password, next to the password click ⌄ and select Copy Secret Reference then op read it:\n$ op read \u0026#34;op://MyVault/xkm4wrtpvnq8hcjd3yfzs2belg/password\u0026#34; my-secret-password The secret reference is made up of the vault name and item ID, and op read doesn\u0026rsquo;t need --reveal.\nTake your pick which one you prefer.\ndirenv #direnv is a handy shell tool that can load and unload environment variables depending on your current directory.\nNext, let\u0026rsquo;s set up direnv so that when you cd into a certain directory, it fetches the password from 1Password and sets it as an env var. When cding out, the env var is unloaded.\nInstall direnv:\nbrew install direnv Then hook direnv into your shell. If you use Oh My Zsh, edit ~/.zshrc and add direnv to the plugins list:\nplugins=(git gitfast gh you-should-use direnv) Restart/reload your shell:\nsource ~/.zshrc (I first got \u0026ldquo;Warning: direnv not found. Please install direnv and ensure it\u0026rsquo;s in your PATH before using this plugin\u0026rdquo; so needed to move eval \u0026quot;$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\u0026quot; before source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh.)\nNow, in your project directory, create a file called .envrc containing an env var export that calls op:\n# .envrc export DEBUG=1 export MY_SECRET=$(op read \u0026#34;op://MyVault/xkm4wrtpvnq8hcjd3yfzs2belg/password\u0026#34;) On first run, you need to explicitly allow direnv to run for this directory. You also need to do this when editing .envrc later:\ndirenv allow . If 1Password is set up with a passkey, it will now prompt to authorise:\n$ cd my-project direnv: loading ~/my-project/.envrc direnv: export +DEBUG +MY_SECRET Sometimes it shows a warning because of the 1Password UI prompt, but it\u0026rsquo;s okay:\n$ cd my-project direnv: loading ~/my-project/.envrc direnv: ([/opt/homebrew/bin/direnv export zsh]) is taking a while to execute. Use CTRL-C to give up. direnv: export +DEBUG +MY_SECRET Then you can access the env var in your scripts:\n$ echo ${DEBUG-nope} 1 $ echo ${MY_SECRET-nope} my-secret-password But when leaving the directory, you can no longer access it:\n$ cd .. direnv: unloading $ echo ${DEBUG-nope} nope $ echo ${MY_SECRET-nope} nope Bonus #1Password offers Team accounts to open-source projects as a way of giving back to the open source community.\nUpdate #2026-01-11:\nSee how Ned Batchelder explicitly sets and unsets env vars, and updates the prompt and window title to make it clear they\u0026rsquo;re active.\nSee how Miguel Grinberg uses process substitution to limit access to secrets from Bash scripts.\nHeader photo: Slaymaker Barry Co.

Each then downloads and installs the hooks when needed, then runs the lint tools.\nSecond, because running the lint tools should be independent and constant time for both tools, the next test ran install-hooks instead of run --all files.\nTo get an idea of the amount of work for these two tests, pre-commit reported initialising environments 217 times.\nFinally, let\u0026rsquo;s run hyperfine on the Pillow config, which installs hooks from 14 repos:\n❯ hyperfine \\ --prepare \u0026#39;rm -rf ~/.cache/prek/ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -rf ~/.cache/pre-commit \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -rf ~/.cache/uv\u0026#39; \\ --setup \u0026#39;prek --version \u0026amp;\u0026amp; pre-commit --version\u0026#39; \\ \u0026#39;prek install-hooks\u0026#39; \\ \u0026#39;pre-commit install-hooks\u0026#39; Results # pre-commit prek Times faster run --all-files 17m13s 7m59s 2.16 install-hooks 10m48s 2m24s 4.50 hyperfine 39.841s 5.539s 7.19 The hyperfine results:\nBenchmark 1: prek install-hooks Time (mean ± σ): 5.539 s ± 0.176 s [User: 8.973 s, System: 5.692 s] Range (min … max): 5.231 s … 5.834 s 10 runs Benchmark 2: pre-commit install-hooks Time (mean ± σ): 39.841 s ± 2.017 s [User: 19.760 s, System: 8.203 s] Range (min … max): 36.930 s … 43.976 s 10 runs Summary prek install-hooks ran 7.19 ± 0.43 times faster than pre-commit install-hooks Give it a try and give it a ⭐!\nBonus #These are the aliases I have set for pre-commit and prek:\nalias pci=\u0026#34;pre-commit install --allow-missing-config\u0026#34; alias pcu=\u0026#34;pre-commit uninstall\u0026#34; alias pca=\u0026#34;pre-commit autoupdate --jobs 0\u0026#34; alias pcr=\u0026#34;pre-commit run --all-files\u0026#34; alias pki=\u0026#34;prek install --allow-missing-config\u0026#34; alias pku=\u0026#34;prek uninstall\u0026#34; alias pka=\u0026#34;prek autoupdate --jobs 0\u0026#34; alias pkr=\u0026#34;prek run --all-files\u0026#34; Where:\ninstall\u0026rsquo;s --allow-missing-config prevents failing with an error code when a repo has no config file autoupdate\u0026rsquo;s --jobs 0 uses all the available threads to make it faster Header photo: AH-1G Aircraft Maintenance Test Flight Handbook and handwritten checklist for helicopters in the San Diego Air and Space Museum Archive, with no known copyright restrictions.\n","date":"6 September 2025","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/ready-prek-go/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Ready prek go!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/testing/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"testing"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/europython/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"europython"},{"content":"Some out-of-context quotes:\n\u0026ldquo;We can just bump the version and move on.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ndash; Dr. Brett Cannon \u0026ldquo;You just show up.

This clearly shows up as a non-run test in the coverage report. In this case, we only need to rename one of them, and both are covered and pass.\nBut sometimes there\u0026rsquo;s a bug in the test which would cause it to fail, but we just don\u0026rsquo;t know because it\u0026rsquo;s not run.\nTip 1: This can also be found by Ruff\u0026rsquo;s F811 rule. Tip 2: pytest\u0026rsquo;s parametrize is a great way to combine similar test functions with different input data. Example two #This is more subtle:\nim = Image.new(\u0026#34;RGB\u0026#34;, (1, 1)) for colors in ((\u0026#34;#f00\u0026#34;,), (\u0026#34;#f00\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;#0f0\u0026#34;)): append_images = (Image.new(\u0026#34;RGB\u0026#34;, (1, 1), color) for color in colors) im_reloaded = roundtrip(im, save_all=True, append_images=append_images) assert_image_equal(im, im_reloaded) assert isinstance(im_reloaded, MpoImagePlugin.MpoImageFile) assert im_reloaded.mpinfo is not None assert im_reloaded.mpinfo[45056] == b\u0026#34;0100\u0026#34; for im_expected in append_images: im_reloaded.seek(im_reloaded.tell() + 1) assert_image_similar(im_reloaded, im_expected, 1) It\u0026rsquo;s not so obvious when looking at the code, but Codecov highlights a problem:\nThe append_images generator is being consumed inside roundtrip(), so we have nothing to iterate over in the for loop \u0026ndash; hence no coverage. The fix is to use a list instead of a generator.\nHeader photo: Misplaced manhole cover (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0 Hugo van Kemenade).\n","date":"27 June 2025","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/run-coverage-on-tests/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Run coverage on tests"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/etymology/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"etymology"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/history/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"history"},{"content":"PEPs #Here\u0026rsquo;s Barry Warsaw on the origin of PEPs, or Python Enhancement Proposals (edited from PyBay 2017):\nI like backronyms. For those who don\u0026rsquo;t know: a backronym is where you come up with the acronym first and then you come up with the thing that the acronym stands for. And I like funny sounding words, like FLUFL was one of those. When we were working for CNRI, they also ran the IETF conferences. The IETF is the Internet Engineering Task Force, and they\u0026rsquo;re the ones who come up with the RFCs. If you look at RFC 822, it defines what an email message looks like.\nWe got to a point, because we were at CNRI we were more intimately involved in the IETF and how they do standards and things, we observed at the time that there were so many interesting ideas coming in being proposed for Python that Guido really just didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to dive into the details of everything.\nSo I thought: well, we have this RFC process, let\u0026rsquo;s try to mirror some of that so that we can capture the essence of an idea in a document that would serve as a point of discussion, and that Guido could let people discuss and then come in and read the summary of the discussion.\nAnd I was just kind of thinking: well, PEPs, that\u0026rsquo;s kind of peppy, it\u0026rsquo;s kind of a funny sounding word. I came up with the word and then I backronymed it into Python Enhancement Proposal. And then I wrote PEP 0 and PEP 1. PEP 0 was originally handwritten, and so I was the first PEP author because I came up with the name PEP.\nBut the really interesting thing is that you see the E.P. part used in a lot of other places, like Debian has DEPs now. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of other communities that have these enhancement proposals so it\u0026rsquo;s kind of interesting. And then the format of the PEP was directly from that idea of the RFC\u0026rsquo;s standard.\n\u0026amp; Co. #Here\u0026rsquo;s a collection of enhancement proposals from different communities.\nAcronym Name AIP Airflow Improvement Proposals AIP API Improvement Proposals APE Astropy Proposals for Enhancement BIP Bitcoin Improvement Proposals CEP Conda Enhancement Proposals CFEP conda-forge\u0026rsquo;s Enhancement Proposals DEP Debian Enhancement Proposals DEP Django Enhancement Proposals FEP Fediverse Enhancement Proposals GLEP Gentoo Linux Enhancement Proposal IPEP IPython Enhancement Proposals JEP JDK Enhancement Proposals JEP JMESPath Enhancement Proposals JEP Jupyter Enhancement Proposals KEP Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals NEP NumPy Enhancement Proposals PEEP Pipenv Enhancement Proposals PEP Python Enhancement Proposals SKIP scikit-image proposals SLEP Scikit-learn enhancement proposals SPEC Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination TIP Tcl Improvement Proposals WEP Write the Docs Enhancement Proposals XEP XMPP Extension Protocols YTEP yt Enhancement Proposals Are there more?

Supported by Germany\u0026rsquo;s Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, they recognise the importance of open source and its place as critical digital infrastructure in the public interest. In their own words:\nThe Sovereign Tech Agency supports the development, improvement, and maintenance of open digital infrastructure. Our goal is to sustainably strengthen the open source ecosystem. We focus on security, resilience, technological diversity, and the people behind the code.\nWe often don’t notice how much our lives depend on digital infrastructure until it stops working. But making it available, accessible and secure is key for digitalization in the public interest. The Sovereign Tech Agency invests in open digital infrastructure. It is critical for innovation and economic growth, and forms the foundation for digitalization across sectors.\nIn addition to CPython core development and release management, I\u0026rsquo;ll continue to maintain other Python projects such as Pillow, humanize and termcolor, and CLI utilities such as norwegianblue, pypistats and pepotron, and help out more widely in the Python ecosystem.\nTasks include:\nBug fixing, issue triaging, PR review and security improvements Mentoring new contributors to foster community growth and diversity Communicating updates to the wider community via blog posts and social media Workflow, CI, and infrastructure optimisations to streamline core development tasks Maintenance and improvement of PEP editing infrastructure and related documentation tools Automation and dashboard creation for triage scripts to assist other contributors Process and workflow improvements for CI and core contributor environments Ongoing documentation enhancements, including hosting monthly Documentation Working Group meetings, improving build processes, and focusing on accessibility Updating and modernising projects for compatibility with the latest Python versions Implementing stronger security measures and using Trusted Publishing and digital attestations Adding and maintaining Python support for widely used PyPI packages Improving community-wide tooling, documentation, and accessibility Meet my fellow Sovereign Tech Fellows, and by the way, the Sovereign Tech Agency is currently hiring, check out their open positions.\n","date":"6 February 2025","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/im-excited-to-join-the-sovereign-tech-fellowship/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"I'm excited to join the Sovereign Tech Fellowship"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/sovereign-tech-fellowship/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"Sovereign-Tech-Fellowship"},{"content":"Prologue #This was a Twitter thread from 15th January 2022 about my first CPython bug. Eight days from report to fix to merge, not bad!\nDelay #I helped delay the release of Python 3.11.0a4! But in a good way! 😇\nPython 3.11 is due out in October, but they make early alpha, beta and release candidates available for people to help test Python itself and their own code before the big release.\nSo I tested Pillow\u0026hellip;\nTests #The Pillow test suite passed with 3.11 ✅\nNext I tried building the documentation with 3.11 ❌\nThe docs program, Sphinx, emitted a couple of warnings. Warnings are often missed because they don\u0026rsquo;t error. But luckily we use the \u0026ldquo;-W\u0026rdquo; option to turn warnings into hard errors.\nSphinx #Maybe Sphinx isn\u0026rsquo;t ready for Python 3.11?\nRather than submitting a report with the full Pillow documentation (lots of files) I made a new, \u0026ldquo;minimal\u0026rdquo; example with just enough stuff to reproduce it.\nThis makes it easier to investigate what\u0026rsquo;s up.\nReport 1 #I reported this to Sphinx. The problem was that a page in a subdirectory could load an image from one directory, but not from another, further away directory.\nIt occurs for the Python 3.11.0a3 alpha, but not 3.7-3.10.\nCPython #A few hours later the Sphinx maintainer Takeshi said it looks like a change to a part of Python itself \u0026ndash; os.path.normpath() \u0026ndash; since 3.11.0a3, and as it wasn\u0026rsquo;t mentioned on the \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s New in Python 3.11\u0026rdquo; page it could be a bug in Python.\nHe asked me to report it to Python.\nReport 2 #I reported it to Python with Takeshi\u0026rsquo;s even more minimal example.\nHalf an hour later Christian pointed out a change which may have caused this.\nI tested and confirmed.\nThe next day Steve confirmed it was a bug and set it as a \u0026ldquo;release blocker\u0026rdquo;.\nFix #Steve also said it will needs tests, because this bug slipped out due to a gap in testing.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to fix the bug, but I could write some test cases!\nneonene then took the tests and fixed the bug! In doing so they found even more bugs!\nMerge #These extra bugs also existed in earlier versions.\nBut it turns out path handling can get pretty complicated in places, so Steve decided to only fix my bug now to get it released and the others can be sorted later.\nThe fix was merged and I confirmed it also worked with Sphinx ✅\nConclusion #And that\u0026rsquo;s about it!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now fixed in 3.11.0a4; much better to find these before 3.11.0 final is released to the world in October. Along the way we found more issues to address.\nShort version: test your code with 3.11 now, you may find issues in your code or in Python itself 🚀\nEpilogue #Back to 2025: Please test and delay Python 3.14 alpha \u0026ndash; but in a good way! 😇\n","date":"4 February 2025","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2025/how-to-delay-a-python-release/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"How to delay a Python release"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/twitter/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"twitter"},{"content":"You can get download numbers for PyPI packages (or projects) from a Google BigQuery dataset. You need a Google account and credentials, and Google gives 1 TiB of free quota per month.\nEach month, I have automation to fetch the download numbers for the 8,000 most popular packages over the past 30 days, and make it available as more accessible JSON and CSV files at Top PyPI Packages. This data is widely used for research in academia and industry.\nHowever, as more packages and releases are uploaded to PyPI, and there are more and more downloads logged, the amount of billed data increases too.\nThis chart shows the amount of data billed per month.\nAt first, I was only collecting downloads data for 4,000 packages, and it was fetched for two queries: downloads over 365 days and over 30 days. But as time passed, it started using up too much quota to download data for 365 days.\nSo I ditched the 365-day data, and increased the 30-day data from 4,000 to 5,000 packages. Later, I checked how much quota was being used and increased from 5,000 packages to 8,000 packages.\nBut then I exceeded the BigQuery monthly quota of 1 TiB fetching data for July 2024.\nTo fetch the missing data and investigate what\u0026rsquo;s going in, I started Google Cloud\u0026rsquo;s 90-day, $300 (€277.46) free-trial 💸\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what I found!\nFinding: it costs more to get data for downloads from only pip than from all installers #I use the pypinfo client to help query BigQuery. By default, it only fetches downloads for pip.\nOnly pip #This command gets one day\u0026rsquo;s download data for the top 10 packages, for pip only:\n$ pypinfo --limit 10 --days 1 \u0026#34;\u0026#34; project Served from cache: False Data processed: 58.21 GiB Data billed: 58.21 GiB Estimated cost: $0.29 Results:\nproject download count boto3 37,251,744 aiobotocore 16,252,824 urllib3 16,243,278 botocore 15,687,125 requests 13,271,314 s3fs 12,865,055 s3transfer 12,014,278 fsspec 11,982,305 charset-normalizer 11,684,740 certifi 11,639,584 Total 158,892,247 All installers #Adding the --all flag gets one day\u0026rsquo;s download data for the top 10 packages, for all installers:\n$ pypinfo --all --limit 10 --days 1 \u0026#34;\u0026#34; project Served from cache: False Data processed: 46.63 GiB Data billed: 46.63 GiB Estimated cost: $0.23 project download count boto3 39,495,624 botocore 17,281,187 urllib3 17,225,121 aiobotocore 16,430,826 requests 14,287,965 s3fs 12,958,516 charset-normalizer 12,781,405 certifi 12,647,098 setuptools 12,608,120 idna 12,510,335 Total 168,226,197 So we can see the default pip-only costs an extra 25% data processed and data billed, and costs an extra 25% in dollars.\nUnsurprisingly, the actual download counts are higher for all installers. The ranking has changed a bit, but I expect we\u0026rsquo;re still getting more-or-less the same packages in the top thousands of results.\nQueries #It sends a query like this to BigQuery for only pip:\nSELECT file.project as project, COUNT(*) as download_count, FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads` WHERE timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -2 DAY) AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -1 DAY) AND details.installer.name = \u0026#34;pip\u0026#34; GROUP BY project ORDER BY download_count DESC LIMIT 10 And for all installers:\nSELECT file.project as project, COUNT(*) as download_count, FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads` WHERE timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -2 DAY) AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -1 DAY) GROUP BY project ORDER BY download_count DESC LIMIT 10 These queries are the same, except the default has an extra AND details.installer.name = \u0026quot;pip\u0026quot; condition. It seems reasonable it would cost more to do extra filtering work.\nInstallers #Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the installers:\n$ pypinfo --all --limit 100 --days 1 \u0026#34;\u0026#34; installer Served from cache: False Data processed: 29.49 GiB Data billed: 29.49 GiB Estimated cost: $0.15 installer name download count pip 1,121,198,711 uv 117,194,833 requests 29,828,272 poetry 23,009,454 None 8,916,745 bandersnatch 6,171,555 setuptools 1,362,797 Bazel 1,280,271 Browser 1,096,328 Nexus 593,230 Homebrew 510,247 Artifactory 69,063 pdm 62,904 OS 13,108 devpi 9,530 conda 2,272 pex 194 Total 1,311,319,514 pip still by far the most popular, and unsurprising uv is up there too, with about 10% of pip\u0026rsquo;s downloads.\nThe others are about 25% or less of uv. A lot of them are mirroring services that we wanted to exclude before.\nI think given uv\u0026rsquo;s importance, and my expectation that it will continue to take a bigger share of the pie, plus especially the extra cost for filtering by just pip, means that we should switch to fetching data for all downloaders. Plus the others don\u0026rsquo;t account for that much of the pie.\nFinding: the number of packages doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect the cost #This was the biggest surprise. Earlier I\u0026rsquo;d been increasing or decreasing the number to try and remain under quota. But it turns out it makes no difference how many packages you query!\nI fetched data for just one day and all installers for different package limits: 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000. Sample query:\nSELECT file.project as project, COUNT(*) as download_count, FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads` WHERE timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -2 DAY) AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -1 DAY) GROUP BY project ORDER BY download_count DESC LIMIT 8000 Result: Interestingly, the cost is the same for all limits (1000-8000): $0.31.\nRepeating with one day but filtering for pip only:\nResult: Cost increased to $0.39 but again the same for all limits.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s repeat with all installers, but for 30 days, and this time query in decreasing limits, in case we were only paying for incremental changes: 8000, 7000, 6000, 5000, 4000, 3000, 2000, 1000:\nResult: Again, the cost is the same regardless of package limit: $4.89 per query.\nWell then, let\u0026rsquo;s repeat with the limit increasing by powers of ten, up to 1,000,000! This last one fetches data for all 531,022 packages on PyPI:\nlimit projects count estimated cost bytes billed bytes processed 1 1 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 10 10 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 100 100 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 1000 1,000 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 8000 8,000 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 10000 10,000 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 100000 100,000 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 1000000 531,022 0.20 43,447,746,560 43,447,720,943 Result: Again, same cost, whether for 1 package or 531,022 packages!\nFinding: the number of days affects the cost #No surprise. I\u0026rsquo;d earlier noticed 365 days too took much quota, and I could continue with 30 days.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the estimated cost and bytes billed (for one package, all installers) between one and 30 days (f\u0026quot;pypinfo --all --json --indent 0 --days {days} --limit 1 '' project\u0026quot;), showing a roughly linear increase:\nConclusion # It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how many packages I fetch data for, I might as well fetch all and make it available to everyone, depending on the size of the data file. It will make sense to still offer a smaller file with 8,000 or so packages: often you just need a large-ish yet manageable number.\nIt costs more to filter for only downloads from pip, so I\u0026rsquo;ve switched to fetching data for all installers.\nThe number of days affects the cost, so I will need to decrease this in the future to stay within quota. For example, at some point I may need to switch from 30 to 25 days, and later from 25 to 20 days.\nMore details from the investigation, the scripts and data files can be found at hugovk/top-pypi-packages#36.\nAnd let me know if you know any tricks to reduce costs!\nHeader photo: \u0026ldquo;The Balancing Rock, Stonehenge, Near Glen Innes, NSW\u0026rdquo; by the Royal Australian Historical Society, with no known copyright restrictions.\n","date":"24 November 2024","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2024/a-surprising-thing-about-pypis-bigquery-data/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"A surprising thing about PyPI's BigQuery data"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/big-query/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"big-query"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/google/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"google"},{"content":"We can use uv to make linting and testing on GitHub Actions around 1.5 times as fast.\nLinting #When using pre-commit for linting:\nname: Lint on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch] env: FORCE_COLOR: 1 permissions: contents: read jobs: lint: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: persist-credentials: false - uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: \u0026#34;3.x\u0026#34; cache: pip - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1 We can replace pre-commit/action with tox-dev/action-pre-commit-uv:\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: \u0026#34;3.x\u0026#34; - cache: pip - - uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.1 + - uses: tox-dev/action-pre-commit-uv@v1 name: Lint on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch] env: FORCE_COLOR: 1 permissions: contents: read jobs: lint: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: persist-credentials: false - uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: \u0026#34;3.x\u0026#34; - uses: tox-dev/action-pre-commit-uv@v1 This means uv will create virtual environments and install packages for pre-commit, which is faster for the initial seed operation when there\u0026rsquo;s no cache.\nLint comparison #For example: python/blurb#32\nBefore After Times faster No cache 60s 37s 1.62 With cache 11s 11s 1.00 Testing #When testing with tox:\nname: Test on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch] permissions: contents: read env: FORCE_COLOR: 1 jobs: test: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: python-version: [\u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.11\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.12\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.13\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.14\u0026#34;] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: persist-credentials: false - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} allow-prereleases: true cache: pip - name: Install dependencies run: | python --version python -m pip install -U pip python -m pip install -U tox - name: Tox tests run: | tox -e py We can replace tox with tox-uv:\n- name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} allow-prereleases: true - cache: pip - - name: Install dependencies - run: | - python --version - python -m pip install -U pip - python -m pip install -U tox + - name: Install uv + uses: hynek/setup-cached-uv@v2 - name: Tox tests run: | - tox -e py + uvx --with tox-uv tox -e py name: Test on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch] permissions: contents: read env: FORCE_COLOR: 1 jobs: test: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: python-version: [\u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.11\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.12\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.13\u0026#34;] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: persist-credentials: false - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} allow-prereleases: true - name: Install uv uses: hynek/setup-cached-uv@v2 - name: Tox tests run: | uvx --with tox-uv tox -e py tox-uv is tox plugin to replace virtualenv and pip with uv in your tox environments.

While the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase (Tuesday 2024-07-30). Our goal is to have no ABI changes after beta 4 and as few code changes as possible after 3.13.0rc1, the first release candidate. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as much exposure for 3.13 as possible during the beta phase.\nTest with 3.13 #It\u0026rsquo;s now time for us library maintainers to start testing our projects with 3.13. There\u0026rsquo;s two big benefits:\nThere have been removals and changes in Python 3.13. Testing now helps us make our code compatible and avoid any big surprises (for us and our users) at the big launch in October.\nWe might find bugs in Python itself! Reporting those will help get them fixed and help everyone.\nHow #GitHub Actions: setup-python #To test the latest alpha, beta or release candidate with actions/setup-python, add 3.13 and allow-prereleases: true to your workflow matrix.\nFor example:\njobs: test: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: python-version: [\u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.11\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.12\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.13\u0026#34;] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} allow-prereleases: true (We can instead use 3.13-dev and omit allow-prereleases: true, but I find the above a bit neater, and when 3.13.0 final is released in October, it will continue testing with full release versions.)\nGitHub Actions: deadsnakes #For the bleeding edge, we can use deadsnakes/action to test the latest nightly build:\njobs: test: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: python-version: [\u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.11\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.12\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.13-dev\u0026#34;] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v4 - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} if: \u0026#34;!endsWith(matrix.python-version, \u0026#39;-dev\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; uses: actions/setup-python@v5 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} - uses: deadsnakes/action@v3.1.0 name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} (deadsnakes) if: endsWith(matrix.python-version, \u0026#39;-dev\u0026#39;) with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} When to support 3.13? #When should you declare support and add the Programming Language :: Python :: 3.13 Trove classifier? Some projects already have!\nIf you have a pure Python project, you can release now.\nIf you have C extensions and other projects depend on yours, a preview release with wheels will help them test and prepare. I\u0026rsquo;ve already started releasing these.\nABI breaks? #ABI breaks during the beta are infrequent and unintentional. If they happen, you can rebuild your wheels and upload them to an existing PyPI release by adding an optional build tag to the filename:\nThe wheel filename is {distribution}-{version}(-{build tag})?-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl.\nbuild tag: [\u0026hellip;] Acts as a tie-breaker if two wheel file names are the same in all other respects (i.e. name, version, and other tags).\nFor example, this updates the filename and metadata with build number 1, and removes the original file:\npython -m pip install \u0026#34;wheel\u0026gt;=0.4.0\u0026#34; wheel tags --build=1 --remove sampleproject-5.0.0-cp313-cp313-macosx_10_10_x86_64.whl # this creates a file named sampleproject-5.0.0-1-cp313-cp313-macosx_10_10_x86_64.whl Upload it, and the new file will be used instead of the old one.

Each is a crop from an image by NASA\u0026rsquo;s New Horizons spacecraft.\nLink to Source Code #https://github.com/hugovk/bitsofpluto\nPermissive License #MIT\nBackground #For decades, Pluto had only been a speck of light until the NASA\u0026rsquo;s Hubble Space Telescope captured it in never-before-seen detail:\nJust a few years later, I followed the journey of NASA\u0026rsquo;s New Horizons spacecraft in awe as it flew past Pluto, in the far depths of our solar system.\nLike many others I was especially struck by the beautiful photographs it shot, especially this large, detailed image:\nAs NASA describe it:\nNASA’s New Horizons spacecraft captured this high-resolution enhanced color view of Pluto on July 14, 2015. The image combines blue, red and infrared images taken by the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera (MVIC). Pluto’s surface sports a remarkable range of subtle colors, enhanced in this view to a rainbow of pale blues, yellows, oranges, and deep reds. Many landforms have their own distinct colors, telling a complex geological and climatological story that scientists have only just begun to decode. The image resolves details and colors on scales as small as 0.8 miles (1.3 kilometers). The viewer is encouraged to zoom in on the full resolution image on a larger screen to fully appreciate the complexity of Pluto’s surface features.\nI second the recommendation to zoom in on the full resolution! The detail and is astounding, especially compared to the Hubble image.\nI thought it would be fascinating to chop this up and put it in a social media feed to enjoy different aspects of the detail, to punctuate the doomscrolling with a moment of wonder.\nHow I built it #I built the bot in Python. Originally it posted to Twitter, but as the future of bots on Twitter is less than certain, the time was ready to port it over to Mastodon where bots are welcome.\nOn the way, I learned how to calculate brightness in images, how to use the Mastodon API, and how to set up a bot on Linode and (the appropriately-named!) botsin.space.\nThe bot does two things:\nGet a bit of Pluto Post to Mastodon 1. Get a bit of Pluto #The bitsofpluto() function takes a single parameter, the path to the full resolution Pluto image.\nThe image is opened using Pillow.\nWe then choose a random width for the image, somewhere between 800 and 2000 pixels, with height is set to ¾ the width. This is to give a different zoom level each time. We then randomly select a window to crop. This is our potential bit of Pluto.\nBut we don\u0026rsquo;t stop there. The image has quite a large background of empty black (or nearly black) space. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to post that. So we sample 9 points from the image (corners, centre point, and bisecting points) and measure the brightness where 0 is black and 255 is white. If brightness is under 10, we count it as a dark point. If there are 6 or less, we save the image to a temporary directory.\nOtherwise if there are too many dark points, we discard this crop, and start again from the top. I came up with these figures of 10 and 7 through trial-and-error. It\u0026rsquo;s quite nice to sometimes get an image with a corner of Pluto\u0026rsquo;s curvature against the darkness of space:\n2. Post to Mastodon #We use the Mastodon.py library to via the Mastodon API.\nThe toot_it() function first reads in the credentials for posting. I generated them using a helper script I wrote based upon Allison Parrish\u0026rsquo;s instructions.\nOnce authenticated, there\u0026rsquo;s a two-step process for posting:\nUpload the image using api.media_post(), which returns a reference to the media Create the Mastodon post, using the media reference Hosting #Linode #The bot code is hosted on Linode. The nice thing about Mastodon bots is that they rarely need expensive or high-end hosting. I created a Linode using the cheapest option: for $5/month the \u0026ldquo;Nanode 1 GB\u0026rdquo; plan gives 1 GB RAM, 1 CPU and 25 GB storage, more than enough for our needs.\nI chose a Ubuntu 22.04 LTS image: LTS means \u0026ldquo;long-term support\u0026rdquo;, it will be supported for 5 years, until April 2027. And I chose the Frankfurt, DE region because it\u0026rsquo;s closest to me.\nAfter creating a user, I logged in via SSH, and cloned the bitsofpluto repo.\nI ran crontab -e to schedule it to run once every six hours:\n0 */6 * * * /home/botuser/bin/scheduled/0000-06-repeat.sh \u0026gt; /tmp/logs/0000-06-repeat.log Where 0000-06-repeat.sh contains:\n#!/bin/bash #set -e mkdir -p /tmp/logs/ ~/github/bitsofpluto/crontask.sh \u0026gt; /tmp/logs/bitsofpluto.log 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 Which, when the cron triggers, switches to the repo, fetches any recent changes, and then runs the bot to make a post:\npython3 bitsofpluto.py --yaml ~/bin/data/bitsofpluto.yaml --no-web botsin.space #The bot\u0026rsquo;s Mastodon account is on Colin Mitchell\u0026rsquo;s botsin.space instance, home to many other excellent bots.\nAdditional Resources/Info #I\u0026rsquo;ve made two other Mastodon bots:\n@tiny_bus_stop - uses Tracery and Cheap Bots, Toot Sweet! @FlagFacts - uses Python Enjoy!\n","date":"18 February 2023","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2023/bits-of-pluto-on-mastodon/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Bits of Pluto on Mastodon"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/bots/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"bots"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/linode-hackathon/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"linode-hackathon"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/open-source/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"open-source"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/deprecation/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"deprecation"},{"content":"Why? #Often Python core developers think about deprecating and removing old bits of the language.

While the release is planned to be feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase (Monday, 2021-08-02). Our goal is have no ABI changes after beta 4 and as few code changes as possible after 3.11.0rc1, the first release candidate. To achieve that, it will be extremely important to get as much exposure for 3.11 as possible during the beta phase.\nTest with 3.11 #It\u0026rsquo;s now time for library maintainers to start testing 3.11 with your project. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to declare support and release for 3.11 yet, but there\u0026rsquo;s two big benefits to testing with 3.11 on CI:\nThere have been removals and changes in Python 3.11. Testing now will help you make your code compatible and avoid any big surprises (for you and your users) at the big launch in October.\nYou might find bugs in Python itself! Reporting those will help get them fixed and help everyone.\nHow #GitHub Actions: setup-python #To test the latest alpha, beta or release candidate with actions/setup-python, add 3.11-dev to your workflow matrix.\nFor example:\njobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: python-version: [\u0026#34;3.7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.11-dev\u0026#34;] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} uses: actions/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} GitHub Actions: deadsnakes #For the bleeding edge, we can use deadsnakes/action to test the latest nightly build:\njobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest strategy: fail-fast: false matrix: python-version: [\u0026#34;3.7\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;3.11-dev\u0026#34;] steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} if: \u0026#34;!endsWith(matrix.python-version, \u0026#39;-dev\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; uses: actions/setup-python@v3 with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} - uses: deadsnakes/action@v2.1.1 name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} (deadsnakes) if: endsWith(matrix.python-version, \u0026#39;-dev\u0026#39;) with: python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }} Travis CI #I recommend moving to another CI.\nIn the meantime, you can also add 3.11-dev to .travis.yml, although at the time of writing it\u0026rsquo;s pointing to 3.11.0a3 from 2021-12-08, which is better than nothing.\nlanguage: python python: - \u0026#34;3.7\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.8\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.9\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.10\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;3.11-dev\u0026#34; Again, I recommend moving to another CI.\nOther CIs #Do you use other CIs?

The data is automatically committed from the droplet back to the GitHub repository, and GitHub Actions is used to automatically tag and create a release, which then creates a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) at Zenodo to help make it citable for researchers.\nIn more detail #A \u0026ldquo;Droplet\u0026rdquo; is the name DigitalOcean uses for virtual machines, which is basically a Linux server. I\u0026rsquo;m using the cheapest $5/month running Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) plus $1/month for automated backups. (In July 2022, I\u0026rsquo;ll switch to the new $4/month Droplet.)\nOn the first of the month, it runs a cron job:\n13 11 1 * * ( eval \u0026#34;$(ssh-agent -s)\u0026#34;; ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa-top-pypi-packages; /home/botuser/github/top-pypi-packages/top-pypi-packages.sh ) \u0026gt; /tmp/top-pypi-packages.log 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 This script runs some others to call pypinfo:\n/home/botuser/.local/bin/pypinfo --json --indent 0 --limit 5000 --days 30 \u0026#34;\u0026#34; project \u0026gt; top-pypi-packages-30-days.json PyPI streams data about downloads to Google BigQuery which are accessible as a public dataset. Google provides a free amount of queries per month, and I\u0026rsquo;ve been adjusting the amount of data fetched to stay within the free quota (e.g. changing from the top 5k packages to 4k; it used to get data for top packages over the past 30 days and 365 days, but now only for 30 days; and bumping back up to 5k packages).\npypinfo is a handy command-line interface (CLI) to access this BigQuery data and dump it to a JSON file.\nAnother handy CLI tool called jq minifies the JSON data:\njq -c . \u0026lt; top-pypi-packages-30-days.json \u0026gt; top-pypi-packages-30-days.min.json These are then committed back to the repo, tagged using CalVer (e.g. 2022-05) and pushed. GitHub Actions creates a release from the tag.\nThis then creates a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) at Zenodo to help make it citable for researchers.\nThe website, on GitHub Pages, reads in the generated JSON file and shows the top 100 (or 1,000 or 5,000) packages in human-readable form. It\u0026rsquo;s based on Python Wheels, which in nice circular fashion, uses the JSON data from this project.\nThanks #Thanks to PyPI and Google BigQuery for the data; pypinfo and jq for the tools; Python Wheels for making their code open source; and DigitalOcean for sponsoring this project\u0026rsquo;s hosting.

Both increases and decreases may reflect an underlying change in use, and decreases may reflect an acceptance of the words.\nBae (babe) emerged in April 2013, peaked at 3,880 in May 2014 and whilst still popular, has tailed off to 437 by December 2015.\nSimilarly, thot (\"that hoe over there\") emerged in March 2013 and grew steadily to a peak of 1,400 uses in March 2014 and dropped off to 28 by December 2015. Selfie (a shared photo taken with a phone) had a couple of mentions in April 2013, and peaked in March 2014 with 373, ending the year with 18 in December 2015.\nRatchet (a diva) peaked with 130 in March 2014, dropping to 4 by December 2015. All but *ratchet* still show up in the charts.\nChanges from 2014 From 2014:\nFleek, or more fully on fleek, means on point, on the mark, stylish, amazing or impeccable. First mentioned in August 2014, it's dropped off to 14 by December 2015.\nBruh (bro, brother), not a new word but with just a few mentions throughout 2013, picked up in March 2014, and peaked in June/July 2014, but went down to 16 by December 2015 and doesn't make the top charts.\nFuckboy still charts for favibot, but peaked in March 2015 with 202 and down to 37 by year end.\nBoth hella and twizzle have dropped off the charts, the latter being a one-off from the 2014 winter Olympics.\nNew in 2015 Here's a few new to these charts.\nLit is the surprise new entry. It's commonly used as \"lit af\", or \"lit as fuck\", for example in this tweet:\nMy Year is starting off lit af👌🏼 ...but is gonna be TD by Monday morning\nSomething, I'm not sure what, happened in June 2015 that caused its use to explode on Twitter:\nFam (from family, for those closest to you but not necessarily family), has been around a long time, became popular towards the end of 2014 and is still talked about.\nSimilarly, slay (\"killed it. succeeded in something amazing\", \"something you tell someone when they look sexy as f***\") has been around for a while and grew towards the end of 2014, peaking in April 2015.\n2016 For words causing a reaction in 2016, follow @lovihatibot, @nixibot and @favibot on Twitter.\n","date":"2 January 2016","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2016/twitter-woty-2015/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Words of the year from Twitter, 2015"},{"content":"David-Antoine Williams writes:\nWhat is the difference between a catch-all and a catch-phrase? Both are compounds formed as Verb+Noun, but in catch-all, the noun is the direct object of the verb, whereas in catch-phrase it is the subject. That is, a catch-all is something that catches all things, whereas a catch-phrase is not something that catches phrases – it is a phrase that catches something. Get it?\nRecently there has been some discussion of catch-all type compounds, which Brianne Hughes has named “cutthroat compounds,” after one of the more suggestive of these. Apparently they’re rare, because they violate a general tendency for compounds in English to put the ‘head’ (e.g. phrase) on the right (‘right-headedness’). Compare F. ouvre-bouteille to E. bottle-opener (not open-bottle), which follows the most common English productive pattern, Object-Verb+er. If catch-all had followed the normal pattern, we’d be talking about an all-catcher, as we talk about dog-catchers and wind-catchers.\nD-AW went on to write a script that unlurked some cutthroats, searching for verbs with left-headed combinations recorded in the entry. I decided to write a script to try another approach -- look for hyphenated nouns where the first part can a verb and the second a noun.\nA WordNet list of 117,953 nouns was reduced to just 3,937 hyphenated words, then further reduced to 916 verb-nouns (i.e. a single hyphen, no spaces) via the Wordnik API, then manually whittled down. Of these potential cutthroats, the following aren't yet on Brianne's list:\nbe-all cease-fire counter-revolution counter-sabotage cross-classification cross-division cross-eye cross-purpose cross-question cross-stitch dangle-berry dash-pot do-good drop-leaf end-all fuss-budget knock-knee make-work squint-eye sweep-second I've been generous with some of these, some might originally be adjective-noun but can also be seen as verb-noun: it can be argued counter-revolutions are things that counters revolutions, cross-questions are things (also questions) that cross other questions (there are more counter- and cross- words like this). Some might just be wrong, but here they are.\nHere's the ones it found that are already on Brianne's list:\nbreak-axe cure-all do-nothing drop-seed know-all make-peace rest-harrow save-all shove-ha'penny, shove-halfpenny shut-eye spend-all And in case I missed any, the full list of 916 verb-nouns is here alongside the Python script.\n","date":"26 May 2015","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2015/cutthroat-verb-nouns/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Cutthroat verb-nouns"},{"content":"Strong Language, the swearing blog, recently wrote about Clusterboinks and clusterfornications: The children of clusterfuck.\nThree of my Twitter bots have been collecting words from Twitter since 2013.

First mentioned in August 2014, it's still riding the peak. First used on\u0026nbsp;Vine by Peaches Monroe in June 2014, it was later popularised by Ariana Grande, who sang the Vine on MTV in August.\nBruh\u0026nbsp;(bro, brother), not a new word but with just a few mentions throughout 2013, picked up in March 2014, and peaked in June/July 2014. Use is likely\u0026nbsp;spurred on by its use in a\u0026nbsp;Vine clip\u0026nbsp;from May 2014 and in copied Vines:\nCallHimBzar took the clip, and a friend of his named Headgraphix, added a disappointed “bruh” as Farmer collapsed. The “bruh” is meant to imply, “bruh, you’re a 6’7, 220-lb guy, and you beat the shit out of your girlfriend, quit acting like a bitch.” The Vine quickly blew up, and after seeing all the excitement surrounding the Vine, Headgraphix and CallHimBzar started the #BruhMovement, encouraging others to make their own Bruh Vines. And Bruh Vine they did… to the \u0026nbsp;tune of\u0026nbsp;thousands\u0026nbsp;of Bruh vines.\nLikewise, fuckboy isn't new, but has seen increasing mentions. Know Your Meme says:\n“Fuckboy” used as a pejorative toward men who are perceived as oversexed or disrespectful toward women.\u0026nbsp;On Tumblr, the term has also spawned a derivative phrase “en garde (English: on your guard), fuckboy,\" which is often accompanied with images of skeletons in a similar vein to 2Spooky.\nIntensifier hella\u0026nbsp;saw some use in 2013, but it increased in 2014 peaking between February and August.\nFinally, twizzle was a one-off coinciding with the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics. Virtually every mention was in February 2014 nearly all as a \"favorite word\" (with US spelling).\u0026nbsp;\nFanSided confirms the US connection to the Olympics:\nIf you have been watching figure skating throughout the 2014 Winter Olympics, it is impossible not to notice the term “twizzle” that is constantly being dropped by Tara Lipinksi and Johnny Weir throughout the Sochi Games.\n2015 For words causing a reaction in 2015, follow\u0026nbsp;@lovihatibot,\u0026nbsp;@nixibot\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;@favibot\u0026nbsp;on Twitter.\n","date":"6 January 2015","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2015/twitter-woty-2014/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Words of the year from Twitter, 2014"},{"content":"I wrote a Python script that searches Twitter for tweets containing \u0026ldquo;[X] is my new favourite word\u0026rdquo;.

See the Mabishu post to see how to check the other commands you can hook up to other keys.\n(Tested with Ubuntu 10.10 and Spotify for Linux preview 0.6.291)\n","date":"13 January 2012","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2012/how-to-toggle-playingpausing-of-spotify-using-the-pause-key-in-ubuntu/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"How to toggle playing/pausing of Spotify using the Pause key in Ubuntu"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/music/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"music"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/tags/s60/","section":"tags","summary":"","title":"S60"},{"content":" KErrNone0 KErrNotFound -1Unable to find the specified object KErrGeneral -2General (unspecified) error KErrCancel -3The operation was cancelled KErrNoMemory -4Not enough memory KErrNotSupported -5The operation requested is not supported KErrArgument -6Bad request KErrTotalLossOfPrecision -7Total loss of precision KErrBadHandle -8Bad object KErrOverflow -9Overflow KErrUnderflow -10Underflow KErrAlreadyExists -11Already exists KErrPathNotFound -12Unable to find the specified folder KErrDied -13Closed KErrInUse -14The specified object is currently in use by another program KErrServerTerminated -15Server has closed KErrServerBusy -16Server busy KErrCompletion -17Completion error KErrNotReady -18Not ready KErrUnknown -19Unknown error KErrCorrupt -20Corrupt KErrAccessDenied -21Access denied KErrLocked -22Locked KErrWrite -23Failed to write KErrDisMounted -24Wrong disk present KErrEof -25Unexpected end of file KErrDiskFull -26Disk full KErrBadDriver -27Bad device driver KErrBadName -28Bad name KErrCommsLineFail -29Comms line failed KErrCommsFrame -30Comms frame error KErrCommsOverrun -31Comms overrun error KErrCommsParity -32Comms parity error KErrTimedOut -33Timed out KErrCouldNotConnect -34Failed to connect KErrCouldNotDisconnect -35Failed to disconnect KErrDisconnected -36Disconnected KErrBadLibraryEntryPoint -37Bad library entry point KErrBadDescriptor -38Bad descriptor KErrAbort -39Interrupted KErrTooBig -40Too big KErrDivideByZero -41Divide by zero KErrBadPower -42Batteries too low KErrDirFull -43Folder full KErrHardwareNotAvailable \u0026nbsp;-44 KErrSessionClosed -45 KErrPermissionDenied \u0026nbsp;-46 Original table of errors nabbed from http://newlc.com/Symbian-OS-Error-Codes.html\n","date":"5 February 2009","permalink":"https://hugovk.dev/blog/2009/symbian-errors-an-illustrated-guide/","section":"Blog","summary":"","title":"Symbian errors, an illustrated catalogue of errors"},{"content":"Another amazing application for S60 phones!
