Another [amazing application](BoozeIt.sis) for S60 phones! (But not S60 3rd Ed.) Like
all the best applications it has a hard-coded exchange rate and a rubbish UI!

Booze It! is the perfect tool for those who like the odd drink or two. It has two modes:
Home and Away.

## Away blurb

Ever been in a foreign pub drinking half a litre of beer (sometimes in a pint glass) and
wondering what it would cost in proper money? Well, it's easy enough to convert from
euros to pounds, either in your head or with your phone's converter app. But that only
gives the price of a half litre when what you really want to know is how much a full
British pint would set you back. Well, this is the app for you!

**Keys:**

- Type the price of the foreign draught with the number keys
- Up key increases the digit at the 'imaginary cursor'
- Down key decreases the digit at the 'imaginary cursor'
- Left/right keys move the 'imaginary cursor'
- Send/green key: Send an SMS to tell your friends about your beer, you may edit before
  sending
- Press \* to toggle between Home and Away modes

**Menu:**

- Glass size: To change the size of the foreign draught. Select either preset sizes or
  enter your own size.
- Change rate: View the current exchange rate, or enter your own, with either euro or
  pound as the base. _Note: the exchange rate isn't stored and will be reset to the
  default when you exit..._
- Send via SMS: Send an SMS to tell your friends about your beer, you may edit before
  sending
- Send via Bluetooth: Share this amazing application with a friend!

## Home blurb

Picture the scene: you're in an off licence or supermarket, choosing some booze for a
party. It's easy to see which is the cheapest, but which gives the most alcohol for your
hard earned pound? You have to account for number of cans or bottles, volume in each,
percentage, and price. Simply consult Booze It! to help **Choose Your Booze!**

The home mode currently has a very dodgy UI. Sorry. You have to imagine a cursor, and
use the left and right keys to move the cursor to the digit you want to change. You then
press up or down to increase or decrease the digit at the cursor.

**Keys:**

- Up key increases the digit at the 'imaginary cursor'
- Down key decreases the digit at the 'imaginary cursor'
- Left/right keys move the 'imaginary cursor'
- Send/green key: Send a booze report via SMS, you may edit before sending
- Press \* to toggle between Home and Away modes

**Menu:**

- Send via SMS: Send a booze report, you may edit before sending
- Send via Bluetooth: Share this amazing application with a friend!
