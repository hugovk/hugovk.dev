Starting in 2019, Python [3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) and
[3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) release manager Łukasz Langa
added a new section to the release notes called "And now for something completely
different" with a sketch transcript from Monty Python.

For Python
[3.10](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-10-0-is-now-available/10955?u=hugovk#p-39262-and-now-for-something-completely-different-4)
and
[3.11](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-11-0-final-is-now-available/20291?u=hugovk#p-71754-and-now-for-something-completely-different-6),
the next release manager Pablo Galindo Salgado continued the section but included
astrophysics facts.

For Python
[3.12](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-12-0-final-is-here/35186?u=hugovk#p-118859-and-now-for-something-completely-different-7),
the next RM Thomas Wouters shared poems (and took a break for 3.13).

And for Python 3.14, I'm doing all things _π_, pie and \[mag]pie.

Here's a collection of my different things for the first year (and a bit) of Python
3.14.

## alpha 1

[2024-10-15](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-1/68039?u=hugovk)

_π_ (or pi) is a mathematical constant, approximately 3.14, for the ratio of a circle’s
circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational number, which means it cannot be
written as a simple fraction of two integers. When written as a decimal, its digits go
on forever without ever repeating a pattern.

Here’s 76 digits of _π_:

3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286

Piphilology is the creation of mnemonics to help remember digits of _π_.

In a pi-poem, or “piem”, the number of letters in a word equal the corresponding digit.
This covers 9 digits, 3.14159265:

> _How I wish I could recollect pi easily today!_

One of the most well-known covers 15 digits, 3.14159265358979:

> _How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum
> mechanics!_

Here’s a 35-word piem in the shape of a circle, 3.1415926535897932384626433832795728:

> _It’s a fact_ _A ratio immutable_ _Of circle round and width,_ _Produces geometry’s
> deepest conundrum._ _For as the numerals stay random,_ _No repeat lets out its
> presence,_ _Yet it forever stretches forth._ _Nothing to eternity._

The Guinness World Record for memorising the most digits is held by Rajveer Meena, who
recited 70,000 digits blindfold in 2015. The unofficial record is held by Akira
Haraguchi who recited 100,000 digits in 2006.

## alpha 2

[2024-11-19](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-2/71711?u=hugovk)

Ludolph van Ceulen (1540-1610) was a fencing and mathematics teacher in Leiden,
Netherlands, and spent around 25 years calculating _π_ (or pi), using essentially the
same methods Archimedes employed some seventeen hundred years earlier.

Archimedes estimated _π_ by calculating the circumferences of polygons that fit just
inside and outside of a circle, reasoning the circumference of the circle lies between
these two values. Archimedes went up to polygons with 96 sides, for a value between
3.1408 and 3.1428, which is accurate to two decimal places.

Van Ceulen used a polygon with half a billion sides. He published a 20-decimal value in
his 1596 book
[_Vanden Circkel_](https://old.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-van-ceulen-s-vanden-circkel)
([“On the Circle”](https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/ludolph-van-ceulen/)),
and later expanded it to 35 decimals:

3.14159265358979323846264338327950288

Van Ceulen’s 20 digits is more than enough precision for any conceivable practical
purpose. For example, even if a printed circle was perfect down to the atomic scale, the
thermal vibrations of the molecules of ink would make most of those digits physically
meaningless. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s highest accuracy calculations, for
interplanetary navigation, uses 15 decimals: 3.141592653589793.

At Van Ceulen’s request, his upper and lower bounds for _π_ were engraved on his
[tombstone in Leiden](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ludolph-van-ceulen-memorial-leiden).
The tombstone was eventually lost but restored in 2000. In the Netherlands and Germany,
π is sometimes referred to as the “Ludolphine number”, after Van Ceulen.

## alpha 3

[2024-12-17](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-3/74542?u=hugovk)

A mince pie is a small, round covered tart filled with “mincemeat”, usually eaten during
the Christmas season – the UK consumes some 800 million each Christmas. Mincemeat is a
mixture of things like apple, dried fruits, candied peel and spices, and originally
would have contained meat chopped small, but rarely nowadays. They are often served warm
with brandy butter.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest mention of Christmas mince pies
is by Thomas Dekker, writing in the aftermath of the
[1603 London plague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1603_London_plague), in
[_Newes from Graues-end: Sent to Nobody_](https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_newes-from-graues-end-s_gravesend_1604/page/n10/mode/1up?q=mince+pyes)
(1604):

> Ten thousand in London swore to feast their neighbors with nothing but plum-porredge,
> and mince-pyes all Christmas.

Here’s a meaty recipe from
[_Rare and Excellent Receipts, Experienc’d and Taught by Mrs Mary Tillinghast and now Printed for the Use of her Scholars Only_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Rare_and_Excellent_Receipts/PZfbqUrHykwC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22mince+pies%22&pg=PA9&printsec=frontcover)
(1678):

> XV. _How to make Mince-pies._
>
> To every pound of Meat, take two pound of beef Suet, a pound of Corrants, and a
> quarter of an Ounce of Cinnamon, one Nutmeg, a little beaten Mace, some beaten Colves,
> a little Sack & Rose-water, two large Pippins, some Orange and Lemon peel cut very
> thin, and shred very small, a few beaten Carraway-seeds, if you love them the Juyce of
> half a Lemon squez’d into this quantity of meat; for Sugar, sweeten it to your relish;
> then mix all these together and fill your Pie. The best meat for Pies is
> Neats-Tongues, or a leg of Veal; you may make them of a leg of Mutton if you please;
> the meat must be parboyl’d if you do not spend it presently; but if it be for present
> use, you may do it raw, and the Pies will be the better.

## alpha 4

[2025-01-14](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-4/77112?u=hugovk)

In Python, you can use Greek letters as constants. For example:

```python
from math import pi as π

def circumference(radius: float) -> float:
    return 2 * π * radius

print(circumference(6378.137))  # 40075.016685578485
```

## alpha 5

[2025-02-11](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-5/80364?u=hugovk)

2025-01-29 marked the start of a new lunar year, the Year of the Snake :snake: (and the
Year of Python?).

For centuries, _π_ was often approximated as 3 in China. Some time between the years 1
and 5 CE, astronomer, librarian, mathematician and politician Liu Xin (劉歆) calculated
_π_ as 3.154.

Around 130 CE, mathematician, astronomer, and geographer Zhang Heng (張衡, 78–139)
compared the celestial circle with the diameter of the earth as 736:232 to get 3.1724.
He also came up with a formula for the ratio between a cube and inscribed sphere as 8:5,
implying the ratio of a square’s area to an inscribed circle is √8:√5. From this, he
calculated _π_ as √10 (~3.162).

Third century mathematician Liu Hui (刘徽) came up with an algorithm for calculating _π_
iteratively: calculate the area of a polygon inscribed in a circle, then as the number
of sides of the polygon is increased, the area becomes closer to that of the circle,
from which you can approximate _π_.

This algorithm is similar to the method used by Archimedes in the 3rd century BCE and
Ludolph van Ceulen in the 16th century CE (see
[3.14.0a2 release notes](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-2/71711?u=hugovk)),
but Archimedes only went up to a 96-sided polygon (96-gon). Liu Hui went up to a 192-gon
to approximate _π_ as 157/50 (3.14) and later a 3072-gon for 3.14159.

Liu Hu wrote a commentary on the book The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art which
included his _π_ approximations.

In the fifth century, astronomer, inventor, mathematician, politician, and writer Zu
Chongzhi (祖沖之, 429–500) used Liu Hui’s algorithm to inscribe a 12,288-gon to compute
_π_ between 3.1415926 and 3.1415927, correct to seven decimal places. This was more
accurate than Hellenistic calculations and wouldn’t be improved upon for 900 years.

Happy Year of the Snake!

[2025-03-14](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-6/84513?u=hugovk)

March 14 is celebrated as [pi day](https://www.exploratorium.edu/pi), because 3.14 is an
approximation of _π_. The day is observed by eating pies (savoury and/or sweet) and
celebrating _π_. The first pi day was organised by physicist and tinkerer Larry Shaw of
the San Francisco [Exploratorium](https://annex.exploratorium.edu/learning_studio/pi/)
in 1988. It is also the [International Day of Mathematics](https://www.idm314.org/) and
Albert Einstein’s birthday. Let’s all eat some pie, recite some _π_, install and test
some py, and wish a happy birthday to Albert, Loren and all the other pi day children!

## beta 1

[2025-05-07](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-beta-1-is-here/91117?u=hugovk)

The mathematical constant pi is represented by the Greek letter _π_ and represents the
ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. The first person to use _π_ as a
symbol for this ratio was Welsh self-taught mathematician William Jones in 1706. He was
a farmer’s son born in Llanfihangel Tre’r Beirdd on Angelsy (Ynys Môn) in 1675 and only
received a basic education at a local charity school. However, the owner of his parents’
farm noticed his mathematical ability and arranged for him to move to London to work in
a bank.

By age 20, he served at sea in the Royal Navy, teaching sailors mathematics and helping
with the ship’s navigation. On return to London seven years later, he became a maths
teacher in coffee houses and a private tutor. In 1706, Jones published _Synopsis
Palmariorum Matheseos_ which used the symbol _π_ for the ratio of a circle’s
circumference to diameter (hunt for it on pages
[243](https://archive.org/details/SynopsisPalmariorumMatheseosOrANewIntroductionToTheMathematics/page/n261/mode/1up?view=theater)
and
[263](https://archive.org/details/SynopsisPalmariorumMatheseosOrANewIntroductionToTheMathematics/page/n283/mode/1up?view=theater)
or
[here](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Synopsis_Palmariorum_Matheseos_pi.jpg)).
Jones was also the first person to realise _π_ is an irrational number, meaning it can
be written as decimal number that goes on forever, but cannot be written as a fraction
of two integers.

But why _π_? It’s thought Jones used the Greek letter _π_ because it’s the first letter
in _perimetron_ or perimeter. Jones was the first to use _π_ as our familiar ratio but
wasn’t the first to use it in as part of the ratio. William Oughtred, in his 1631
_Clavis Mathematicae_ (_The Key of Mathematics_), used _π/δ_ to represent what we now
call pi. His _π_ was the circumference, not the ratio of circumference to diameter.
James Gregory, in his 1668 _Geometriae Pars Universalis_ (_The Universal Part of
Geometry_) used _π/ρ_ instead, where _ρ_ is the radius, making the ratio 6.28… or
[_τ_](https://www.tauday.com/). After Jones, Leonhard Euler had used _π_ for 6.28…, and
also _p_ for 3.14…, before settling on and popularising _π_ for the famous ratio.

[2025-05-26](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-beta-2-is-here/93396?u=hugovk)

In 1897, the State of Indiana almost passed a bill defining _π_ as 3.2.

Of course, it’s not that simple.

Edwin J. Goodwin, M.D., claimed to have come up with a solution to an ancient
geometrical problem called squaring the circle, first proposed in Greek mathematics. It
involves trying to draw a circle and a square with the same area, using only a compass
and a straight edge. It turns out to be impossible because _π_ is transcendental (and
this had been proved just 13 years earlier by Ferdinand von Lindemann), but Goodwin
fudged things so the value of _π_ was 3.2 (his writings have included at least nine
different values of _π_: including 4, 3.236, 3.232, 3.2325… and even 9.2376…).

Goodwin had copyrighted his proof and offered it to the State of Indiana to use in their
educational textbooks without paying royalties, provided they endorsed it. And so
Indiana Bill No. 246 was introduced to the House on 18th January 1897. It was not
understood and initially referred to the House Committee on Canals, also called the
Committee on Swamp Lands. They then referred it to the Committee on Education, who duly
recommended on 2nd February that “said bill do pass”. It passed its second reading on
the 5th and the education chair moved that they suspend the constitutional rule that
required bills to be read on three separate days. This passed 72-0, and the bill itself
passed 67-0.

The bill was referred to the Senate on 10th February, had its first reading on the 11th,
and was referred to the Committee on Temperance, whose chair on the 12th recommended
“that said bill do pass”.

A mathematics professor,
[Clarence Abiathar Waldo](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/14641808#page/455/mode/1up),
happened to be in the State Capitol on the day the House passed the bill and walked in
during the debate to hear an ex-teacher argue:

> The case is perfectly simple. If we pass this bill which establishes a new and correct
> value for pi , the author offers to our state without cost the use of his discovery
> and its free publication in our school text books, while everyone else must pay him a
> royalty.

Waldo ensured the senators were “properly coached”; and on the 12th, during the second
reading, after an unsuccessful attempt to amend the bill it was postponed indefinitely.
But not before the senators had some fun.

The Indiana News reported on the 13th:

> …the bill was brought up and made fun of. The Senators made bad puns about it,
> ridiculed it and laughed over it. The fun lasted half an hour. Senator Hubbell said
> that it was not meet for the Senate, which was costing the State $250 a day, to waste
> its time in such frivolity. He said that in reading the leading newspapers of Chicago
> and the East, he found that the Indiana State Legislature had laid itself open to
> ridicule by the action already taken on the bill. He thought consideration of such a
> proposition was not dignified or worthy of the Senate. He moved the indefinite
> postponement of the bill, and the motion carried.

All this talk of _π_ and yet some say _π_ is wrong. [Tau Day](https://www.tauday.com/)
(June 28th, 6/28 in the US) celebrates _τ_ as the “true circle constant”, as the ratio
of a circle’s circumference to its radius, _C/r_ = 6.283185… The
[Tau Manifesto](https://www.tauday.com/tau-manifesto) declares _π_ “a confusing and
unnatural choice for the circle constant”, in part because “2*π* occurs with astonishing
frequency throughout mathematics”.

If you wish to embrace _τ_ the good news is [PEP 628](https://peps.python.org/pep-0628/)
added [`math.tau`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.tau) to Python 3.6
in 2016:

> When working with radians, it is trivial to convert any given fraction of a circle to
> a value in radians in terms of `tau`. A quarter circle is `tau/4`, a half circle is
> `tau/2`, seven 25ths is `7*tau/25`, etc. In contrast with the equivalent expressions

Today, 22nd July, is Pi Approximation Day, because 22/7 is a common approximation of _π_
and closer to _π_ than 3.14.

22/7 is a Diophantine approximation, named after Diophantus of Alexandria (3rd century
CE), which is a way of estimating a real number as a ratio of two integers. 22/7 has
been known since antiquity; Archimedes (3rd century BCE) wrote the first known proof
that 22/7 overestimates _π_ by comparing 96-sided polygons to the circle it
circumscribes.

Another approximation is 355/113. In Chinese mathematics, 22/7 and 355/113 are
respectively known as Yuelü (约率; yuēlǜ; “approximate ratio”) and Milü (密率; mìlǜ;
“close ratio”).

The magpie, _Pica pica_ in Latin, is a black and white bird in the crow family, known
for its chattering call.

The first-known use in English is from a
[1589 poem](https://archive.org/details/transactionscong5191cong/page/360/mode/2up?q=magpy),
where magpie is spelled “magpy” and cuckoo is “cookow”:

<em>Th[e]y fly to wood like breeding hauke, And leave old neighbours loue, They pearch
themselves in syluane lodge, And soare in th’ aire aboue. There : magpy teacheth them to
chat, And cookow soone doth hit them pat.</em>

The name comes from Mag, short for Margery or Margaret (compare robin redbreast, jenny
wren, and its corvid relative jackdaw); and pie, a magpie or other bird with black and
white (or pied) plumage. The sea-pie (1552) is the oystercatcher, the grey pie (1678)
and murdering pie (1688) is the great grey shrike. Others birds include the yellow and
black pie, red-billed pie, wandering tree-pie, and river pie. The rain-pie, wood-pie and
French pie are woodpeckers.

Pie on its own dates to before 1225, and comes from the Latin name for the bird, _pica_.

According to Pablo Galindo Salgado at

## 3.14.0 (final)

[2025-10-07](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-final-is-here/104210?u=hugovk)

Edgar Allen Poe died on 7th October 1849.

As we all recall from
[3.14.0a1](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-0-alpha-1/68039?u=hugovk#p-199032-and-now-for-something-completely-different-3),
piphilology is the creation of mnemonics to help memorise the digits of _π_, and the
number of letters in each word in a pi-poem (or “piem”) successively correspond to the
digits of _π_.

In 1995, Mike Keith, an American mathematician and author of constrained writing, retold
Poe’s _The Raven_ as a 740-word piem. Here’s the first two stanzas of
[_Near A Raven_](http://www.cadaeic.net/naraven.htm):

> <strong>Poe, E. Near a Raven</strong>
>
> Midnights so dreary, tired and weary. Silently pondering volumes extolling all by-now
> obsolete lore. During my rather long nap - the weirdest tap! An ominous vibrating
> sound disturbing my chamber’s antedoor. “This”, I whispered quietly, “I ignore”.
>
> Perfectly, the intellect remembers: the ghostly fires, a glittering ember. Inflamed by
> lightning’s outbursts, windows cast penumbras upon this floor. Sorrowful, as one
> mistreated, unhappy thoughts I heeded: That inimitable lesson in elegance - Lenore -
> Is delighting, exciting…nevermore.

[2025-12-02](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-14-1-is-now-available/105163?u=hugovk)

Seki Takakazu (関 孝和; c. March 1642 – December 5, 1708) was a Japanese mathematician
and samurai who laid the foundations of Japanese mathematics, later known as _wasan_
(和算, from _wa_ (“Japanese”) and _san_ (“calculation”).

Seki was a contemporary of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz but worked independently.
He created a new algebraic system, worked on infinitesimal calculus, and is credited
with the discovery of Bernoulli numbers (before Bernoulli’s birth).

Seki also
[calculated _π_ to 11 decimal places](https://dl.ndl.go.jp/en/pid/3508174/1/13) using a
polygon with 131,072 sides inscribed within a circle, using an acceleration method now
known as Aitken’s delta-squared process, which was rediscovered by Alexander Aitken
in 1926.
