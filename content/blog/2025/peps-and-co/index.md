## PEPs

Here's [Barry Warsaw](https://barry.warsaw.us/) on the origin of
[PEPs](https://peps.python.org/), or Python Enhancement Proposals (edited from
[PyBay 2017](https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NrPCsH0mBU?start=1662&end=1803)):

> I like backronyms. For those who don't know: a backronym is where you come up with the
> acronym first and then you come up with the thing that the acronym stands for. And I
> like funny sounding words, like [FLUFL](https://peps.python.org/pep-0401/) was one of
> those. When we were working for CNRI, they also ran the IETF conferences. The IETF is
> the Internet Engineering Task Force, and they're the ones who come up with the RFCs.
> If you look at [RFC 822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822), it defines
> what an email message looks like.
>
> We got to a point, because we were at CNRI we were more intimately involved in the
> IETF and how they do standards and things, we observed at the time that there were so
> many interesting ideas coming in being proposed for Python that Guido really just
> didn't have time to dive into the details of everything.
>
> So I thought: well, we have this RFC process, let's try to mirror some of that so that
> we can capture the essence of an idea in a document that would serve as a point of
> discussion, and that Guido could let people discuss and then come in and read the
> summary of the discussion.
>
> And I was just kind of thinking: well, PEPs, that's kind of peppy, it's kind of a
> funny sounding word. I came up with the word and then I backronymed it into Python
> Enhancement Proposal. And then I wrote [PEP 0](https://peps.python.org/pep-0000/) and
> [PEP 1](https://peps.python.org/pep-0001/). PEP 0 was originally handwritten, and so I
> was the first PEP author because I came up with the name PEP.
>
> But the really interesting thing is that you see the E.P. part used in a lot of other
> places, like Debian has DEPs now. There's a lot of other communities that have these
> enhancement proposals so it's kind of interesting. And then the format of the PEP was
> directly from that idea of the RFC's standard.
