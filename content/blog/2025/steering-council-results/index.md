Welcome Savannah for the first time, and thank you to
[Greg Smith](https://infosec.exchange/@gpshead) and
[Emily Morehouse](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyemorehouse.bsky.social) for four and
three years' service each.

Three are starting their sixth terms, and four members have been or are
[release managers](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).

The [chart above](https://hugovk.github.io/python-steering-council/) only covers the
Steering Council years. Let's also not forget Guido van Rossum's
[BDFL years](https://hugovk.github.io/python-steering-council/bdfl.html):
