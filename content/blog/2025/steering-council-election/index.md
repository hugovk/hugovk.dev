The Python Steering Council election is on!

This year six candidates are running for the five seats. See
[PEP 8107](https://peps.python.org/pep-8107/) for links to their nomination statements
and [PEP 13](https://peps.python.org/pep-0013/) for more on Python language governance.

I made a chart to show when the nominations arrived during the nomination period: six is
fewer than in previous years, but they didn't all wait until the last three days like in
2023 and 2024.

This year we're also using a new voting system: with
["Multi-winner Bloc STAR"](https://www.starvoting.org/multi_winner) you give between 0-6
stars per candidate.

If you're in the core team, remember to vote by Friday!
