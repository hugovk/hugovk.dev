I wrote a Python script that searches Twitter for tweets containing "[X] is my new
favourite word". It then takes all those new favourite words, logs them, lowercases
them, and adds them to a list of words on Wordnik. And, from this week, it also tweets
them and makes word clouds.

It also does the same for "[X] is my new favorite word" and "[X] is my new fave word" so
you can see some geographic variation.

It's been going six months since 24th February 2013, runs nearly every day, and has
found some 18,360 new favourite words.

Here's top tens for the whole set and each subset.

What does this tell us? I don't know, but whilst the top ten contains lots of swearing,
around half (or about 2/3 for favourites) of each list contains unique words. Browsing
the lists shows lots of neologisms (and neoswearisms).
