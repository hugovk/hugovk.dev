These settings work for sending on the
[Nokia 6680](https://web.archive.org/web/20050318101754/http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,1522,,00.html?orig=/6680),
but not receiving... I used to be able to receive as well, but at least sending works
and means I can use the "Send as email" option in things like
[Lifeblog](https://web.archive.org/web/20050305085929/http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,,54630,00.html),
and use Opera or the phone's built-in Web app to check received email at gmail.com.
