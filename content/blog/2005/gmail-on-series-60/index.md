These settings work for sending on the [Nokia 6680](http://www.nokia.com/6680/), but not
receiving... I used to be able to receive as well, but at least sending works and means
I can use the "Send as email" option in things like
[Lifeblog](http://www.nokia.com/lifeblog), and use Opera or the phone's built-in Web app
to check received email at gmail.com.
